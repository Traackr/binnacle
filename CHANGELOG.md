## [Unreleased]

- None at this time.

## [0.2.1] - 2020-01-13

- Remove the explicit '--force' from the command passed to helm3 upgrade during a `binnacle sync`.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-01-13

- This release introduces Helm 3 support by adding a lightweight touchpoint to detect if helm2 or helm3 is getting targetted and treating helm2 as the exception case for processing.  This will allow helm2 support to be easily removed upon its EOL.  To facilitate this detected binnacle will run `helm version` during certain commands to help determine the target version and change the underlying helm commands accordingly.

## [0.1.1] - 2018-11-09

- The 0.1.0 release improperly used the 0.0.5 version.  This change is the exact functionality as 0.1.0 but with the version correctly updated.

## [0.1.0] - 2018-11-09

- maps read from YAML values were being transformed into `map[string]string`, but will now be `map[string]interface{}` to maintain the values' types

## [0.0.5] - 2018-07-20

### Notes

- The 0.0.4 release improperly used the 0.0.3 version.  This change is the exact functionality as 0.0.4 but with the version correctly updated.

## [0.0.4] - 2018-07-20

### Notes

- The `binnacle` binaries were improperly build as non-static binaries.  They have been converted to static binaries.
- The Darwin build of `binnacle` was not working properly on Travis.  This has been resolved.

## [0.0.3] - 2018-07-12

### Notes

- The 0.0.2 release improperly used the 0.0.1 version.  This change is the exact functionality as 0.0.2 but with the version correctly updated.
