# binnacle [![Release][release-image]][release-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]

`binnacle` is an opinionated automation tool used to interact with Kubernetes' [Helm][helm].  By offering a single file to manage one or many charts, you can easily control all aspects of your Helm managed applications.

`binnacle` is similar in nature to [Helmfile][helmfile] with a slightly different appraoch to managing Helm Charts.

## Installation

A binary for various operating systems is available through [Github Releases][github-releases].  Download the appropriate archive, and extract into a directory within your PATH.

## Usage

For the full list of options:

```shell
binnacle --help
```

To see the version of `binnacle` you can use the following:

```shell
binnacle --version
```

## Getting Started

### Configuration File Format

Configuration files can be written in YAML, TOML or JSON.

```yaml
---
# charts takes a list of chart configurations
charts:
    # This is the name of the chart
  - name: concourse
    # This is the namespace into which the chart is launched
    namespace: apps
    # This is the name for the release of this chart
    release: apps-concourse
    # This is the name of the repository within which the helm chart is located
    repo: stable
    # This determines if the release is created or removed. Default: present Options: absent, present
    state: present
    # Any data under values are passed to Helm to configure the given chart
    values:
      image: concourse/concourse
      imageTag: "3.10.0"
    # This is the version of the Helm chart.  If this is omitted, the latest is used.
    version: 1.3.1

# repositories takes a list of repository configurations
repositories:
    # This is the name of the repository
  - name: stable
    # This is the URL of the repository
    url: https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
    # This determines if the repository is created or removed. Default: present Options: absent, present
    state: present
```

### Commands

Documentation for all of the commands within `binnacle` are available [here][commands].

### Using Binnacle

The standard workflow when using binnacle is to use the [template][command-template] command to verify the desired configuration files are generated, use the [sync][command-sync] command to create/update the existing release configuration within Helm, and [status][command-status] to get the status of a release.

Using the configuration available at `test-data/demo.yml` you can run the template command:

```bash
$ binnacle template -c ./test-data/demo.yml 
Loading config file: ./test-data/demo.yml
---
# Source: concourse/templates/namespace.yaml

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/resource-policy": keep
  name: apps-concourse-main
  labels:
...
```

By reviewing the output you are able to verify that you have specificied all of the necessary configuration aspects of the chart.  Once you are happy with how the chart is configured you can [sync][command-sync] the charts to Helm:

```bash

$  binnacle sync -c ./test-data/demo.yml 
Loading config file: ./test-data/demo.yml
"stable" has been added to your repositories
Release "apps-concourse" does not exist. Installing it now.

NOTES:

* Concourse can be accessed:

  * Within your cluster, at the following DNS name at port 8080:

    apps-concourse-web.apps.svc.cluster.local

  * From outside the cluster, run these commands in the same shell:

    export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace apps -l "app=apps-concourse-web" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
    echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use Concourse"
    kubectl port-forward --namespace apps $POD_NAME 8080:8080

* Login with the following credentials
  
  Username: concourse
  Password: concourse
  
* If this is your first time using Concourse, follow the tutorial at https://concourse-ci.org/hello-world.html

*******************
******WARNING******
*******************

You are using the "naive" baggage claim driver, which is also the default value for this chart. This is the default for compatibility reasons, but is very space inefficient, and should be changed to either "btrfs" (recommended) or "overlay" depending on that filesystem's support in the Linux kernel your cluster is using. Please see https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1230 and https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1966 for background.
```

From the output you can see that the release did not exist "apps-concourse" so Helm created it.  To get updates on the status of the deployment you can use the [status][command-status] command:

```bash

$ binnacle status -c ./test-data/demo.yml

******WARNING******
*******************

You are using the "naive" baggage claim driver, which is also the default value for this chart. This is the default for compatibility reasons, but is very space inefficient, and should be changed to either "btrfs" (recommended) or "overlay" depending on that filesystem's support in the Linux kernel your cluster is using. Please see https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1230 and https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1966 for background.
```

If you want to remove a release, you can change the `state` from `present` to `absent` and run the [sync][command-sync] command:

```bash
$ binnacle sync -c ./test-data/demo.yml 
Loading config file: ./test-data/demo.yml
"stable" has been added to your repositories
These resources were kept due to the resource policy:
[Namespace] apps-concourse-main

release "apps-concourse" deleted
```

## Development

To ease the entry of building `binnacle` there are two methods supported by the local Makefile.  The first is for a fully installed and configured [Go][go] (version 1.8+) environment on your machine, and the second requires only that docker be installed.

### Local Go Environment

You will first want to check out this repository into your GOPATH:

```script
mkdir -p "$GOPATH/src/github.com/Traackr"
cd "$GOPATH/src/github.com/Traackr"
git clone https://github.com/Traackr/binnacle.git
cd binnacle
```

To compile a version of binnacle for your local machine you can run:

```script
make
```

This will generate a binary within the ./bin directory of the project.

To run the unit tests:

```script
make test-unit
```

To run the unit tests with coverage reports:

```script
make test-coverage
```

### Local Docker Environment

Using a local [Docker][docker] environment for building runs the exact same commands as local development, they just happen to be run inside of the container.

To leverage the docker build environment you will first want to check out this repository into a directory of your choice.  In the example below there is an environment variable named `DEVELOPMENT` where all development files are stored.

```script
mkdir -p "$DEVELOPMENT/Traackr"
cd "$DEVELOPMENT/Traackr"
git clone https://github.com/Traackr/binnacle.git
cd binnacle
```

To compile a version of binnacle for your local machine you can run:

```script
make docker-build
```

This will generate a binary within the ./bin directory of the project.

To run the unit tests:

```script
make docker-test-unit
```

To run the unit tests with coverage reports:

```script
make docker-test-coverage
```
